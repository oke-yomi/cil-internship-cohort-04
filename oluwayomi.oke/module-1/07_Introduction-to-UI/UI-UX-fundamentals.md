### UI/UX fundamentals

User experience, or UX, is a term used to describe the overall experience a user has when interacting with a product or service in a given context.
The term “UX” was first coined in the 1990s by Dr. Donald Norman, an electrical engineer and cognitive scientist at Apple.

- User Interface or UI designers also have a solid understanding of the user’s needs and goals, but their speciality lies in the user’s visual experience. Based on the UX designer’s wireframes and prototypes, they design all the visual aspects of the product interface, such as color, typography, and spacing, as well as the interactive touchpoints that the user encounters, such as buttons and scrollbars.
